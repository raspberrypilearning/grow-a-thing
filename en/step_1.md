## Choose a cone
Add an image for the cone that catches the ice-cream scoops

## Step 1
Click on the **Image gallery** icon to see all the image files in this project. Choose the cone you want to use.

## Step 2
Click on **Project file** tab and select script.js.

## Step 3
Change the file name in `load_image()` to the cone you want to use.

<div class="c-project-code">
--- code ---
---
language: javascript
filename: script.js
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 3
line_highlights: 4
---
function preload() {
  cone = loadImage("cone1.png");
}
--- /code ---
</div>

## Step 4
Add the image to the `draw()`

<div class="c-project-callout c-project-callout--tip">

### Tip
- The screen is like a grid, and each image has an x and y position, for example, `image(img, x, y)` 
- The code below that uses the `mouseX` value for the x position. 
</div>

<div class="c-project-code">
--- code ---
---
language: javascript
filename: script.js
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 16
line_highlights: 19
---
function draw() {
    background(100, 80, 30);
}
--- /code ---
</div>

### Now run your code 
You can see cone move with your curser. Edit the y position of the cone image to fit to your screen.
